# Hello-World
Introduction

Hey, my name is Diogo Matias and I'm 22 years old.

Currently learning more about web development, know some html and css and basic javascript for now.
Studied Informatic Engineer but didn't finish it, so I also do have a background in programming retaining some Java (know the paradigms of OOP). Programmed in C and python but didn't continue to practice it. As I said I'm more into web development right now.
